# Same Tree

## Problem Statement

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

## Approach

The given code implements a solution to check if two binary trees are the same. It follows a recursive approach to traverse both trees and compare their nodes. The steps are as follows:

1. Define a helper function `getNodes` that takes a binary tree `root` and a vector `check` as parameters. This function traverses the tree in a pre-order manner and pushes the values of the nodes into the `check` vector. If a node is `NULL`, a sentinel value of -1 is pushed instead.
2. Initialize two empty vectors `first` and `second` to store the values of the nodes in the first and second trees, respectively.
3. Call the `getNodes` function on both trees `p` and `q` to populate the `first` and `second` vectors.
4. Compare the sizes of the `first` and `second` vectors. If they are different, the trees are not the same and we return false.
5. Iterate through the `first` and `second` vectors simultaneously. If any corresponding values are different, the trees are not the same and we return false.
6. If we have iterated through all nodes without finding any differences, the trees are the same and we return true.

## Complexity Analysis

Let's assume `m` is the number of nodes in the first tree and `n` is the number of nodes in the second tree.

- Time Complexity: The code traverses both trees in a pre-order manner, so the time complexity is O(m + n), where m and n are the number of nodes in the respective trees.
- Space Complexity: The code uses additional space to store the values of the nodes in the `first` and `second` vectors, which requires O(m + n) space in the worst case.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void getNodes(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& check) {
        if (root == NULL) {
            check.push_back(-1);
            return;
        }

        check.push_back(root->val);
        getNodes(root->left, check);
        getNodes(root->right, check);
    }

    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        vector<int> first;
        vector<int> second;

        getNodes(p, first);
        getNodes(q, second);

        int i = 0;
        int size = first.size();
        if (size != second.size()) {
            return false;
        }

        while (i < size) {
            if (first[i] != second[i]) {
                return false;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

You can use this code to check if two binary trees are the same by creating an instance of the `Solution` class and calling the `isSameTree` function with the root nodes of the trees as arguments.
```cpp
TreeNode* p = ...; // root of the first binary tree
TreeNode* q = ...; // root of the second binary tree
Solution solution;
bool areSame = solution.isSameTree(p, q);
```
```
