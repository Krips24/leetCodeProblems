# Insert into a Binary Search Tree

## Problem Statement

You are given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to insert into the tree. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

Notice that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return any of them.

## Approach

The given code implements a solution to insert a new node with value `val` into a binary search tree (BST) while maintaining the BST properties. It uses a recursive approach to traverse the BST to find the correct position to insert the new node. The steps are as follows:

1. The function `insertIntoBST` takes the root of the BST and the value `val` to be inserted as input and returns the root node of the updated BST.
2. If the root is `NULL`, i.e., the BST is empty, a new node is created with value `val`, and it becomes the root of the BST. The new node is returned as the updated root.
3. If `val` is less than the value of the current root node, it should be inserted into the left subtree of the current root. To do this, the function is recursively called with `root->left` as the new root and `val` as the value to be inserted.
4. If `val` is greater than or equal to the value of the current root node, it should be inserted into the right subtree of the current root. To do this, the function is recursively called with `root->right` as the new root and `val` as the value to be inserted.
5. After the correct position for insertion is found, the corresponding pointer (left or right) of the current root is updated to point to the newly created node with value `val`.
6. Finally, the function returns the root node of the updated BST.

## Complexity Analysis

Let `n` be the number of nodes in the binary search tree.

- Time Complexity: The time complexity of the `insertIntoBST` function is O(h), where `h` is the height of the binary search tree. In the worst case, the height of the BST is O(n) if the tree is skewed, and in the best case, the height is O(log n) if the tree is balanced.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(h) as well due to the recursive nature of the function. In the worst case, the space complexity is O(n) if the tree is skewed, and in the best case, the space complexity is O(log n) if the tree is balanced.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* insertIntoBST(TreeNode* root, int val) {
        if (root == NULL) return new TreeNode(val);

        if (val < root->val)
            root->left = insertIntoBST(root->left, val);
        else
            root->right = insertIntoBST(root->right, val);

        return root;
    }
};
