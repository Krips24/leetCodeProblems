## Problem: Linked List Cycle

### Problem Description
Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

 
```
Example 1:


Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

### Solution Explanation

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {

      ListNode *fast = head;
      ListNode *slow = head;

      if(head == NULL || head->next == NULL) return false;

      while(fast!=NULL && slow!=NULL)
      {
          fast = fast->next;
          if(fast!=NULL) fast = fast->next;

          slow = slow->next;

        if(slow == fast) return true;

      }
    return false;
    }
};
```

The provided code solves the problem by using the two-pointer approach to detect cycles in a linked list. Here's how it works:

1. The code defines a function `hasCycle` that takes a pointer to the head of a linked list, denoted by `ListNode *head`, as input.

2. It initializes two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, both initially pointing to the head of the linked list.

3. It checks if the head is `NULL` or the head's `next` pointer is `NULL`. If either condition is true, it means the linked list is empty or contains only one node, so there can't be a cycle. In such cases, it returns `false`.

4. The code enters a loop that continues until either the `fast` or `slow` pointer becomes `NULL`.

5. In each iteration of the loop, the `fast` pointer moves two steps ahead by setting `fast = fast->next`. If the `fast` pointer is not `NULL`, it moves another step ahead by setting `fast = fast->next` again.

6. Meanwhile, the `slow` pointer moves one step ahead by setting `slow = slow->next`.

7. After each movement of the pointers, the code checks if the `slow` pointer is equal to the `fast` pointer. If they are equal, it means the pointers have met at the same node, indicating the presence of a cycle in the linked list. In such cases, it returns `true`.

8. If the loop completes without finding a cycle, it means the pointers reached the end of the linked list (`fast` becomes `NULL`), and no cycle was detected. In such cases, it returns `false`.

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The code has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, when there is no cycle, both pointers will traverse the entire linked list once.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) since the code uses only a constant amount of extra space to store the two pointers.
