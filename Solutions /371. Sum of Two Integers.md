# Get Sum of Two Integers

## Problem Statement

Given two integers `a` and `b`, you need to find their sum without using the operators `+` and `-`. Implement the `getSum` function that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum.

```
Example 1:

Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
```

## Approach
The given code uses bitwise operations to perform addition without using the `+` operator. Here's how it works:

1. Initialize a `while` loop that continues until there are no more carry bits left.
2. In each iteration:
   - Compute the carry by performing a bitwise AND (`&`) operation between `a` and `b`. This operation yields the bits that need to be carried over.
   - Compute the sum by performing a bitwise XOR (`^`) operation between `a` and `b`. This operation adds the bits without considering any carry.
   - Update the value of `a` with the sum.
   - Update the value of `b` by left-shifting the carry by 1 position. This is done using the bitwise left shift (`<<`) operator.
3. Once the carry becomes zero, the loop exits, and the final value of `a` is returned as the sum.

The key idea behind this approach is to perform addition using bitwise operations that manipulate individual bits of the numbers. The bitwise AND operation identifies the positions where carry is required, while the bitwise XOR operation performs the actual addition without considering the carry.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this approach is O(log(max(a, b))) since the number of iterations in the `while` loop depends on the number of bits required to represent the larger of the two numbers, `a` and `b`.

The space complexity is O(1) since only a constant amount of additional space is used.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getSum(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            unsigned int carry = a & b;
            a = a ^ b;
            b = carry << 1;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
