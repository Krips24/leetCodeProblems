## Problem: Product of Array Except Self

### Problem Description

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

### Solution Explanation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int> answer;

        int product = 1;
        int countOfZero = 0;

        for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++)
        {
            if(nums[i] != 0) product = product*nums[i];
            else countOfZero++;
        }

       for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++)
       {
           if(nums[i]!=0)
           {
               if(countOfZero>0) answer.push_back(0);
               else answer.push_back(product/nums[i]);
           }
           else{
               if(countOfZero==1) answer.push_back(product);
               else answer.push_back(0);
           }
       }
    return answer;
    }
};
```

The provided code solves the problem by calculating the product of all elements in the array except the current element. Here's how it works:

1. The `productExceptSelf` function takes a vector `nums` as input.

2. It initializes an empty vector `answer` to store the result.

3. It initializes two variables: `product` to store the product of all non-zero elements and `countOfZero` to count the number of zero elements in the array.

4. It iterates through the input array `nums` using a for loop. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `nums.size()-1`.

5. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `nums[i]` is not equal to zero. If it's not zero, it multiplies the current element with the `product` variable.

6. If the current element is zero, it increments the `countOfZero` variable.

7. After the first loop, it iterates through the input array again using another for loop. This loop is used to calculate the result vector `answer`.

8. Inside the second loop, it checks if the current element `nums[i]` is not zero. If it's not zero, it checks the value of `countOfZero`.

9. If `countOfZero` is greater than zero, it means there is at least one zero element in the array. In this case, it pushes 0 to the `answer` vector.

10. If `countOfZero` is zero, it means there are no zero elements in the array. In this case, it pushes the product divided by the current element to the `answer` vector.

11. If the current element is zero, it checks the value of `countOfZero`.

12. If `countOfZero` is 1, it means there is exactly one zero element in the array. In this case, it pushes the product to the `answer` vector.

13. If `countOfZero` is greater than 1, it means there are more than one zero elements in the array. In this case, it pushes 0 to the `answer` vector.

14. Finally, it returns the `answer` vector.

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The code has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the size of the input array `nums`. The code performs two passes through the input array: one for calculating the product and counting the number of zeros, and another for calculating the result vector.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) since the code uses only a constant amount of extra space for the `answer` vector.
