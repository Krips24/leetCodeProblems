# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

## Problem Statement

Given a sorted array of integers `nums`, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once and returns the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

## Approach

The given code provides a solution to remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place. Here's how it works:

1. First, it checks if the `nums` array is empty. If it's empty, there are no duplicates to remove, so it returns 0.

2. It initializes a variable `count` to 1. This variable will keep track of the length of the modified array.

3. It then iterates through the `nums` array starting from the second element (index 1) using a `for` loop.

4. In each iteration, it compares the current element `nums[i]` with the previous element `nums[i - 1]`. If they are not equal, it means the current element is different from the previous one and should be included in the modified array.

5. If the elements are not equal, the code updates the `count`-th position of the `nums` array with the current element. This effectively removes duplicates by overwriting them with the unique elements.

6. The `count` variable is incremented by 1 to keep track of the length of the modified array.

7. After the loop finishes, the `count` variable holds the length of the modified array, and the duplicates have been removed in-place.

8. The code returns the value of `count` as the length of the modified array.

## Complexity Analysis

Let `n` be the number of elements in the `nums` array.

- Time Complexity: The code runs in O(n) time because it iterates through the array once.
- Space Complexity: The code operates in-place with O(1) extra memory, which means it does not use additional data structures based on the input size.

## Code Implementation

Here is the code implementation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) {
            return 0;
        }

        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
                nums[count] = nums[i];
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
