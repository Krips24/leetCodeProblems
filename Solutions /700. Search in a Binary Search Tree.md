# Search in a Binary Search Tree

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary search tree and a value `val`, return the subtree rooted at the node with the given value. If the node does not exist, return `NULL`.

## Approach

The given code implements the search operation in a binary search tree (BST) to find a node with a given value. It follows the following steps:

1. It checks if the root is `NULL`, which means the tree is empty. In such a case, it returns `NULL`.
2. It initializes a pointer `t` to the root node.
3. It enters a loop that continues until the pointer `t` becomes `NULL`.
   - Inside the loop, it compares the value `val` with the value at the current node `t->val`.
     - If `val` is equal to the current node's value, it means the node with the given value is found. It returns the pointer `t`, which points to the node.
     - If `val` is less than the current node's value, it means the desired node lies in the left subtree. It updates the pointer `t` to `t->left`.
     - If `val` is greater than the current node's value, it means the desired node lies in the right subtree. It updates the pointer `t` to `t->right`.
4. If the loop completes without finding the desired node (i.e., `t` becomes `NULL`), it means the node with the given value does not exist in the BST. In such a case, it returns `NULL`.

## Complexity Analysis

Let's assume n is the number of nodes in the binary search tree.

- Time Complexity: In the average case of a balanced binary search tree, the code performs a search operation that takes O(log n) time. However, in the worst case of a heavily skewed tree, the time complexity can be O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(log n) on average and O(n) in the worst case.
- Space Complexity: The code uses a constant amount of additional space for the pointer `t`. The space complexity is O(1).

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* searchBST(TreeNode* root, int val) {
        if (root == NULL)
            return NULL;

        TreeNode* t = root;

        while (t != NULL) {
            if (val == t->val)
                return t;
            if (val < t->val)
                t = t->left;
            else
                t = t->right;
        }
        return NULL;
    }
};
