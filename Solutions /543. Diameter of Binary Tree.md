# Diameter of Binary Tree

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, find the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

## Approach

The given code implements a solution to find the diameter of a binary tree. It uses a recursive approach to calculate the height of the binary tree while updating the diameter in the process. The steps are as follows:

1. The function `diameterOfBinaryTree` takes the root of a binary tree as input and returns an integer representing the diameter of the tree.
2. The function `getHeight` is a helper function that takes a binary tree node as input and returns its height. It also updates the `ans` variable, which stores the diameter of the tree.
3. In the `getHeight` function:
   - The base case is when the node is `NULL`, in which case the height is 0.
   - The height of the left subtree is calculated by recursively calling the `getHeight` function on the left child of the current node.
   - The height of the right subtree is calculated by recursively calling the `getHeight` function on the right child of the current node.
   - The diameter of the tree is updated by comparing the current value of `ans` with the sum of heights of the left and right subtrees, plus 1 (to account for the current node). The maximum of these two values is stored in `ans`.
   - The height of the current node is returned as 1 plus the maximum of the heights of its left and right subtrees.
4. In the `diameterOfBinaryTree` function:
   - If the root of the tree is `NULL`, the diameter is 0, so the function returns 0.
   - Otherwise, the `getHeight` function is called with the root of the tree to calculate the diameter and update the `ans` variable.
   - Finally, the diameter is returned by subtracting 1 from the value of `ans`, as the `ans` variable stores the length of the longest path between any two nodes, and the diameter is defined as the number of edges along the longest path.

## Complexity Analysis

Let `n` be the number of nodes in the binary tree.

- Time Complexity: The code traverses the entire binary tree once in a recursive manner to calculate the height of each node. Hence, the time complexity is O(n).
- Space Complexity: The recursive calls use the call stack, which can consume O(h) space, where `h` is the height of the binary tree. In the worst case, for a skewed binary tree, the height can be equal to `n`, resulting in O(n) space complexity.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int ans = 0;
    
    int getHeight(TreeNode *root) {
        if (root == NULL)
            return 0;

        int lHeight = getHeight(root->left);
        int rHeight = getHeight(root->right);

        ans = max(ans, 1 + lHeight + rHeight);
        return 1 + max(lHeight, rHeight);
    }

    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == NULL)
            return 0;
        getHeight(root);
        return ans - 1;
    }
};
```

You can use this code to find the diameter of a given binary tree by creating an instance of the `Solution` class and calling the `diameterOfBinaryTree` function with the root node of the binary tree as the argument.

```cpp
TreeNode* root = ...; // root of the binary tree
Solution solution;
int diameter = solution.diameterOfBinaryTree(root);
```

The variable `diameter` will then store the length of the diameter of the binary tree.
