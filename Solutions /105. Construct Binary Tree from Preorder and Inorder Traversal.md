# Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

## Problem Statement

Given two arrays `preorder` and `inorder` representing the preorder and inorder traversals of a binary tree, construct the binary tree and return its root.

## Approach

The given code implements a solution to construct a binary tree from its preorder and inorder traversals. It uses a recursive approach to build the binary tree. The steps are as follows:

1. The function `createTree` takes two vectors `preorder` and `inorder`, along with the start and end indices of the current inorder traversal range, and returns the root of the binary tree that can be constructed from the given range.
2. The `preInd` variable is used to keep track of the index in the `preorder` vector as we build the binary tree.
3. In the `createTree` function:
   - The base case is when the `start` index becomes greater than the `end` index, which means there are no elements in the current inorder range. In this case, the function returns `NULL`.
   - A new `TreeNode` is created with its value set to the value at the `preInd` index in the `preorder` vector.
   - The `pos` variable is used to find the position of the current node's value in the inorder vector. This position divides the inorder vector into left and right subtrees of the current node.
   - The left subtree of the current node is constructed by recursively calling the `createTree` function on the range from `start` to `pos-1` in the inorder vector.
   - The right subtree of the current node is constructed by recursively calling the `createTree` function on the range from `pos+1` to `end` in the inorder vector.
   - Finally, the `TreeNode` is returned.
4. The `buildTree` function takes the `preorder` and `inorder` vectors as input and returns the root of the binary tree constructed using the `createTree` function. It sets the initial range for the `createTree` function as the entire inorder vector, which is from `0` to `inorder.size() - 1`.

## Complexity Analysis

Let `n` be the number of nodes in the binary tree.

- Time Complexity: The code visits each node exactly once during the construction of the binary tree, and for each node, it searches for its position in the inorder vector using a linear search. Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case. However, if we use a hash table or unordered map to store the indices of elements in the inorder vector, we can reduce the time complexity to O(n).
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n) due to the recursive calls in the call stack.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int preInd = 0;

    TreeNode* createTree(vector<int>& preorder, vector<int>& inorder, int start, int end) {
        if (start > end) {
            return NULL;
        }
        TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(preorder[preInd++]);
        int pos;
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            if (inorder[i] == node->val) {
                pos = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        node->left = createTree(preorder, inorder, start, pos - 1);
        node->right = createTree(preorder, inorder, pos + 1, end);
        return node;
    }

    TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>& preorder, vector<int>& inorder) {
        return createTree(preorder, inorder, 0, inorder.size() - 1);
    }
};
