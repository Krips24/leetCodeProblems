# Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level, and alternate between).

## Approach

The given code implements the zigzag level order traversal of a binary tree. It follows a breadth-first search (BFS) approach using a queue. The steps are as follows:

1. The function `zigzagLevelOrder` takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns a vector of vectors of integers representing the zigzag level order traversal.
2. It first checks if the root is `NULL`. If so, it means that the tree is empty, and there are no nodes. Therefore, it returns an empty vector.
3. If the root is not `NULL`, it initializes an empty queue called `q` to perform the BFS traversal, a vector of vectors called `main` to store the zigzag level order traversal, and an integer `level` to keep track of the current level.
4. It starts by pushing the root node into the queue and setting `level` to 1.
5. While the queue is not empty, it performs the following steps:
   - Create a new vector called `primary` to store the nodes' values at the current level.
   - Get the current size of the queue, which represents the number of nodes in the current level.
   - Iterate `i` from 0 to `size-1` to process each node in the current level.
   - Pop the front node from the queue and store it in a temporary variable, `node`.
   - If the left child of the current node is not `NULL`, it is pushed into the queue.
   - If the right child of the current node is not `NULL`, it is pushed into the queue.
   - Push the value of the current node into the `primary` vector.
   - If the current level is even (i.e., `level % 2 == 0`), reverse the order of the values in the `primary` vector using the `reverse` function.
   - After processing all the nodes in the current level, push the `primary` vector into the `main` vector.
   - Increment the `level` variable to move to the next level.
6. Finally, it returns the `main` vector containing the zigzag level order traversal of the binary tree.

## Complexity Analysis

Let's assume n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

- Time Complexity: The code visits each node once and performs a constant amount of operations for each node. Hence, the time complexity is O(n).
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is determined by the maximum number of nodes in a level, which can be at most n/2. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> zigzagLevelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == NULL)
            return {};

        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        vector<vector<int>> main;
        int level = 1;
        q.push(root);

        while (!q.empty()) {
            vector<int> primary;

            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                if (node->left != NULL)
                    q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right != NULL)
                    q.push(node->right);
                primary.push_back(node->val);
            }

            if (level % 2 == 0) {
                reverse(primary.begin(), primary.end());
            }

            main.push_back(primary);
            level++;
        }
        return main;
    }
};
```

This code takes the root of a binary tree as input and returns a vector of vectors of integers representing the zigzag level order traversal of the tree. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal using a queue to store the nodes and processes them one level at a time. The values of the nodes at each level are stored in separate vectors, which are then added to the `main` vector to represent the zigzag level order traversal. In even levels, the order of the values is reversed using the `reverse` function before adding them to the `main` vector.
