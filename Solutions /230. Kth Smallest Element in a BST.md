# Kth Smallest Element in a BST

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1
```

## Approach

The given code implements an inorder traversal of the BST to collect all the elements in a vector, `v`. Once all the elements are collected, the `kthSmallest` function returns the kth element from the vector.

The inorder traversal is performed using a recursive approach:
1. The `inorder` function takes a pointer to the root of the BST as input.
2. In each recursive call, it traverses the left subtree by calling `inorder` on the left child of the current node.
3. It then pushes the value of the current node into the `v` vector.
4. Finally, it traverses the right subtree by calling `inorder` on the right child of the current node.

After the inorder traversal, the `kthSmallest` function returns the kth element from the `v` vector.

## Complexity Analysis

Let's assume n is the number of nodes in the BST.

- Time Complexity: The inorder traversal visits all nodes in the BST once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n) because the `v` vector stores all the values of the BST.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> v;

    void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root)
            return;
        inorder(root->left);
        v.push_back(root->val);
        inorder(root->right);
    }

    int kthSmallest(TreeNode* root, int k) {
        inorder(root);
        return v[k - 1];
    }
};
```
