# Average of Levels in Binary Tree

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

## Approach

The given code implements a solution to find the average value of nodes on each level of a binary tree. It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the tree level by level. The steps are as follows:

1. The function `averageOfLevels` takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns a vector `ans` containing the average values of nodes on each level.
2. If the root is `NULL`, i.e., the tree is empty, the function returns an empty vector.
3. A queue `q` is used to perform a BFS traversal of the binary tree. The root is pushed into the queue initially.
4. While the queue is not empty, a loop is executed for each level of the binary tree:
   - The size of the queue at the beginning of each loop iteration is the number of nodes at the current level.
   - A variable `sum` is used to keep track of the sum of node values at the current level. It is initialized to 0.
   - A loop iterates `size` times, and for each iteration:
     - A node is dequeued from the front of the queue.
     - The value of the dequeued node is added to the `sum`.
     - If the node has a left child, it is enqueued into the queue.
     - If the node has a right child, it is also enqueued into the queue.
   - After the loop, the average value of nodes at the current level is calculated as `sum/size`, and this value is added to the `ans` vector.
5. Once the BFS traversal is complete, the `ans` vector contains the average values of nodes on each level of the binary tree.
6. Finally, the function returns the `ans` vector.

## Complexity Analysis

Let `n` be the number of nodes in the binary tree and `h` be the height of the tree.

- Time Complexity: The code performs a BFS traversal of the binary tree, visiting each node exactly once. Hence, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(m), where m is the maximum number of nodes at any level in the binary tree. In the worst case, the maximum number of nodes at any level is roughly half of the total number of nodes in the last level, which is O(n/2) or O(n) in the worst case. Hence, the space complexity is O(n).

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<double> averageOfLevels(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<double> ans;
        if (root == NULL) return ans;

        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            double sum = 0.0;

            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                sum += node->val;
                if (node->left != NULL) q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right != NULL) q.push(node->right);
            }
            ans.push_back(sum / size);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

You can use this code to find the average values of nodes on each level of a binary tree by creating an instance of the `Solution` class and calling the `averageOfLevels` function with the root of the binary tree as an argument.

```cpp
TreeNode* root = ...; // root of the binary tree
Solution solution;
vector<double> averages = solution.averageOfLevels(root);
```

The variable `averages` will then store the average values of nodes on each level of the binary tree.
