# Finding Maximum Consecutive Ones

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of binary values (0 or 1). Your task is to find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in the array.

## Approach

The provided code offers a solution to find the maximum number of consecutive ones in the given array. Here's how it works:

1. It initializes two integer variables, `count` and `maxCount`, both initially set to 0. These variables will be used to keep track of the current count of consecutive ones and the maximum count found so far.

2. It iterates through the `nums` array using a `for` loop.

3. In each iteration, it checks if the current element is equal to 1. If it is, it increments the `count` by 1, indicating the presence of consecutive ones.

4. If the current element is not 1 (i.e., it's 0), it means that the consecutive ones have ended. In this case, it updates `maxCount` to be the maximum of the current `count` and the previous `maxCount`, effectively tracking the maximum consecutive ones found.

5. After the loop finishes, it checks one more time to ensure that any consecutive ones at the end of the array are counted correctly and updates `maxCount` again accordingly.

6. Finally, it returns the value of `maxCount`, which represents the maximum number of consecutive ones in the array.

## Complexity Analysis

Let `n` be the number of elements in the input array `nums`.

- Time Complexity: The code iterates through the array once, so the time complexity is O(n).

- Space Complexity: The code uses a constant amount of space for variables, so the space complexity is O(1).

## Code Implementation

Here is the code implementation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int maxCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 1) {
                count++;
            } else {
                maxCount = max(count, maxCount);
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        maxCount = max(count, maxCount);
        return maxCount;
    }
};
