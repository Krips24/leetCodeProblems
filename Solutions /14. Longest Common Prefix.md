## Problem: Longest Common Prefix

### Problem Description

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 
```
Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```
```
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

### Solution Explanation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string longestCommonPrefix(vector<string>& strs) {
        string longestPrefix = "";
        int size = strs.size();

        sort(strs.begin(), strs.end());

        string firstString = strs[0];
        string lastString = strs[size-1];

        for(auto x = 0; x<firstString.size(); x++)
        {
            if(firstString[x] == lastString[x])
            {
               // longestPrefix.push_back(firstString[x]) ;
               longestPrefix += firstString[x];
            }
            else break;
        }
        return longestPrefix;
      
    }
};
```

The provided code solves the problem by finding the longest common prefix among the strings in the input array. Here's how it works:

1. The `longestCommonPrefix()` function takes a vector of strings `strs` as input.

2. It initializes an empty string variable `longestPrefix` to store the longest common prefix.

3. The code sorts the input strings using the `sort()` function. Sorting the strings helps in finding the common prefix efficiently.

4. It assigns the first string in the sorted array to the string variable `firstString` and the last string to the string variable `lastString`.

5. Using a `for` loop, the code iterates through the characters of the `firstString` (which is guaranteed to be the smallest string).

6. Inside the loop, it checks if the character at index `x` in `firstString` is equal to the character at the same index in `lastString`. If the characters are equal, the character is appended to the `longestPrefix` string using the `+=` operator.

7. If the characters are not equal, it means the common prefix ends at the current index. In this case, the loop breaks.

8. Once the loop finishes, the function returns the `longestPrefix` string, which contains the longest common prefix among the input strings.

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The time complexity of the given code is O(n * m * log(n)), where n is the number of strings in the input array and m is the maximum length of the strings. This is because the code performs sorting (O(n * log(n))) and then iterates through the characters of the smallest string (O(m)) to find the common prefix.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) as the code uses a constant amount of extra space to store variables.
