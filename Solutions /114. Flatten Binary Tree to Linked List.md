# Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list" in-place. The flattened tree should have the same structure as a pre-order traversal of the original binary tree, where each node's right child points to the next node of the flattened tree, and the left child is set to `NULL`.

## Approach

The given code implements a solution to flatten a binary tree into a linked list in-place. It follows a recursive approach to flatten the tree. The steps are as follows:

1. The function `flatten` takes a binary tree `root` as input and returns nothing (void).
2. The base cases of the recursion are:
   - If `root` is `NULL`, or
   - If `root` has no left and right child, i.e., it is a leaf node.
   In these cases, there is nothing to flatten, so the function simply returns.
3. If `root` has a left child:
   - Recursively call the `flatten` function on the left subtree to flatten it.
   - Store the right child of `root` in a temporary variable `temp`, as it will be overridden.
   - Set the right child of `root` to be the flattened left subtree (root->left).
   - Set the left child of `root` to `NULL`, as we are converting the tree to a linked list, and there should be no left child.
   - Find the rightmost node (leaf) in the newly flattened right subtree and set its right child to `temp`, which is the original right child of `root`.
4. Recursively call the `flatten` function on the right subtree of `root`.

## Complexity Analysis

Let `n` be the number of nodes in the binary tree.

- Time Complexity: The code traverses the binary tree in a recursive manner, visiting each node once. Hence, the time complexity is O(n).
- Space Complexity: The recursive calls use the call stack, which can consume O(n) space in the worst case for a skewed binary tree. However, the rest of the space is constant, so the overall space complexity is O(n).

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void flatten(TreeNode* root) {

        if(root == NULL || (root->left==NULL && root->right==NULL)) return;

        if(root->left!=NULL){
            flatten(root->left);

            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            root->right = root->left;
            root->left = NULL;

            TreeNode* t = root->right;
            while(t->right!=NULL) t=t->right;

            t->right = temp;
        }
        flatten(root->right);
    }
};
```

You can use this code to flatten a given binary tree by creating an instance of the `Solution` class and calling the `flatten` function with the root node of the binary tree as the argument.

```cpp
TreeNode* root = ...; // root of the binary tree
Solution solution;
solution.flatten(root);
```

After calling the `flatten` function, the binary tree will be converted to a linked list in-place, with the right child of each node pointing to the next node in the flattened tree, and the left child set to `NULL`.
```
