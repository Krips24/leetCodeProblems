# Reverse Linked List

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the reversed list.

<hr>

## Approach

The given code implements a simple approach to reverse a linked list:
1. It uses a vector, `answer`, to store the values of the linked list in reverse order.
2. First, it checks if the `head` is `NULL`. If so, it returns `NULL` since there is nothing to reverse.
3. It then iterates through the linked list, starting from `head` and moving to the next node until it reaches the end.
4. During each iteration, it adds the value of the current node to the `answer` vector.
5. After collecting all the values in reverse order, it reassigns the values back to the linked list.
   - It uses a pointer `j` that starts from `head` and iterates through the linked list again.
   - Starting from the last element of the `answer` vector, it assigns each value to the `val` field of the current node pointed by `j`.
   - It then moves `j` to the next node.
6. Finally, it returns the `head` of the reversed linked list.

## Complexity Analysis

Let's assume n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

- Time Complexity: The code iterates through all the nodes of the linked list twice. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n).
- Space Complexity: The code uses an additional vector, `answer`, to store the values of the linked list. The space complexity is O(n) to store all the values.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        vector<int> answer;

        if (head == NULL)
            return NULL;

        for (ListNode* i = head; i != NULL; i = i->next)
            answer.push_back(i->val);

        ListNode* j = head;
        for (int i = answer.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            j->val = answer[i];
            j = j->next;
        }

        return head;
    }
};
```
