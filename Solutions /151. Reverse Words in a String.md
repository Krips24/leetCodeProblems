# Reverse Words in a String

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` with words separated by spaces, reverse the order of words.

## Approach

The provided code offers a solution to reverse the order of words in a string. Here's how it works:

1. It initializes a vector of strings named `words`. This vector will store individual words in reverse order.

2. The code starts from the end of the input string `s` and iterates backward using a `while` loop. The variable `i` is used to keep track of the current position.

3. Within the first `while` loop, the code skips trailing spaces. It continues decrementing `i` while it encounters spaces at the end of the string.

4. After handling trailing spaces, the code checks if `i` is less than 0. If it is, this means that we have reached the beginning of the string (all spaces), so the loop is exited.

5. The code then finds the last character of the current word (denoted by the index `i`) by looking for the first space before it. It uses another `while` loop with the variable `j` to find the position of the last character of the word. The character before `j` is a space, which indicates the end of the word.

6. Once it identifies the last character of the word, it extracts the word using the `substr` function and adds it to the `words` vector.

7. The value of `i` is then updated to the position before the space (position `j`) to prepare for the next word.

8. After processing all words, the code initializes an empty string `result`, which will store the reversed string.

9. It iterates through the `words` vector and appends each word to the `result`. If it's not the last word, it adds a space to separate the words.

10. Finally, the code returns the `result` string, which contains the words of the input string `s` in reverse order.

## Complexity Analysis

Let `n` be the length of the string `s`.

- Time Complexity: The code iterates through the string once, resulting in O(n) time complexity.
- Space Complexity: The code uses additional space to store the words, which takes O(n) space.

## Code Implementation

Here is the code implementation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        vector<string> words;
        int i = s.size() - 1;
        while (i >= 0) { 
            while (i >= 0 && s[i] == ' ') {
                i--;
            }
            if (i < 0) break; 
            int j = i;
            while (j >= 0 && s[j] != ' ') {
                j--; 
            }
            words.push_back(s.substr(j + 1, i - j)); 
            i = j; 
        }
        string result;
        for (int k = 0; k < words.size(); k++) {
            result += words[k];
            if (k < words.size() - 1) {
                result += ' '; 
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
