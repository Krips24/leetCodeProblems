## Problem: Max Number of K-Sum Pairs

### Problem Description
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array.

Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.
```

### Solution Explanation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        int i = 0;
        int j = nums.size()-1;
        int count = 0;

        while(i<j)
        {
            if(nums[i]+nums[j]==k)
            {
                count++;
                i++;
                j--;
            }
            else if(nums[i]+nums[j]<k) i++;
            else j--;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

The provided code solves the problem by using the two-pointer approach to find distinct pairs that sum up to `k`. Here's how it works:

1. The code defines a function `maxOperations` that takes a reference to a vector of integers `nums` and an integer `k` as input.

2. It sorts the input array `nums` in non-decreasing order using the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` library. Sorting the array allows us to use the two-pointer approach efficiently.

3. It initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, pointing to the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively.

4. It initializes a variable `count` to keep track of the count of distinct pairs.

5. It enters a loop that continues until `i` becomes greater than or equal to `j`. This condition ensures that both pointers have not crossed each other.

6. In each iteration of the loop, it checks if the sum of the elements at indices `i` and `j` is equal to `k`. If the sum is equal to `k`, it means we have found a distinct pair that satisfies the condition. In such cases, it increments the `count` variable, moves the `i` pointer one step ahead by incrementing `i++`, and moves the `j` pointer one step back by decrementing `j--`.

7. If the sum of the elements at indices `i` and `j` is less than `k`, it means the sum needs to be increased. In such cases, it moves the `i` pointer one step ahead by incrementing `i++`.

8. If the sum of the elements at indices `i` and `j` is greater than `k`, it means the sum needs to be decreased. In such cases, it moves the `j` pointer one step back by decrementing `j--`.

9. After the loop completes, it returns the value of the `count` variable, which represents the maximum number of distinct pairs that sum up to `k`.

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The code has a time complexity of O(N log N), where N is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. The dominant operation is the sorting of the array, which takes O(N log N) time. The subsequent two-pointer traversal takes linear time.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) since the code uses only a constant amount of extra space to store the variables.
