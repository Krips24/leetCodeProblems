## Problem: Peak Index in a Mountain Array

### Problem Description
An array arr a mountain if the following properties hold:

arr.length >= 3
There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i] 
arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
Given a mountain array arr, return the index i such that arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1].

You must solve it in O(log(arr.length)) time complexity.

```
Example 1:

Input: arr = [0,1,0]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]
Output: 1
```

### Solution Explanation

The provided code solves the problem by performing a linear scan through the array. Here's how it works:

1. The `peakIndexInMountainArray()` function takes a vector of integers, `arr`, as input.

2. It initializes an integer variable `i` to store the peak index.

3. Using a `for` loop, the function iterates through the elements of the array from index 0 to `arr.size()-1`.

4. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element at index `i` is greater than or equal to the next element at index `i+1`. If this condition is true, it means the peak index has been found, so the function returns `i`.

5. If no peak index is found during the loop, the function returns the last index, `i = arr.size()-1`.

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The time complexity of the given code is O(n), where n is the size of the input array `arr`. This is because the code performs a linear scan through the array.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) as the code uses a constant amount of extra space for the `i` variable.
