# Delete Node in a Binary Search Tree

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary search tree and a key, delete the node with the given key from the tree. If the key does not exist in the tree, return the unchanged tree.

## Approach

The given code implements the deletion of a node in a binary search tree. It follows the following steps:

1. It initializes several pointers: `j` (parent node of `t`), `t` (current node), `e` (successor node of `t`), and `f` (parent node of `e`).
2. It starts by searching for the node with the key value in the binary search tree.
3. If the node is not found (i.e., `t` becomes `NULL`), it returns the unchanged tree.
4. If the node is found, it checks for different scenarios based on the node's children:
   - If the node has no children (`t->left` and `t->right` are both `NULL`), it handles the case where the node is the root or a child of another node. It updates the appropriate parent pointer to `NULL`.
   - If the node has a right child (`t->right` is not `NULL`), it finds the successor node (`e`) by traversing to the right child and then all the way to the leftmost node from there. It handles the case where the right child is the successor (`t->right == e`) and connects the left subtree of `t` to `e`.
   - If the node has only a left child (`t->left` is not `NULL`), it finds the successor node (`e`) by traversing to the left child and then all the way to the rightmost node from there. It handles the case where the left child is the successor (`t->left == e`) and connects the right subtree of `t` to `e`.
5. Finally, it updates the root if the node being deleted is the root or updates the appropriate parent pointer to the successor node (`e`).

## Complexity Analysis

Let's assume n is the number of nodes in the binary search tree.

- Time Complexity: The code performs a search operation in the binary search tree, which takes O(log n) time on average in a balanced tree. In the worst case, where the tree is heavily skewed, the time complexity can be O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(log n) on average and O(n) in the worst case.
- Space Complexity: The code uses a constant amount of additional space for the pointers `j`, `t`, `e`, and `f`. The space complexity is O(1).

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
       TreeNode *j,*t,*e,*f;

t = root;
while(t!=NULL)
{
if(key==t->val) break;

j = t;
if(key<t->val) t = t->left;
else t = t->right;
}

if(t==NULL) return root;

if(t->left==NULL && t->right==NULL)
{
if(t==root)
{
root=NULL;
return root;
}
else if(j->left==t) j->left=NULL;
else j->right=NULL;
return root;
}

if(t->right!=NULL)
{
for(e=t->right;e->left!=NULL;e=e->left) f=e;

if(t->right==e) e->left = t->left;

else
{
e->left = t->left;
e->right = t->right;
f->left = e->right;
}

if(root == t) root = e;
else if(j->left == t) j->left = e;
else j->right = e;
}

else
{
for(e=t->left;e->right!=NULL;e=e->right) f = e;

if(t->left == e) e->right = t->right;

else
{
e->right = t->right;
e->left = t->left;
f->right = e->left;
}

if(root == t) root = e;
else if(j->right==t) j->right = e;
else j->left = e;
}
return root;

    }
};
