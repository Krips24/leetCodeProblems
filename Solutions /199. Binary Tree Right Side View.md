# Binary Tree Right Side View

## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

## Approach

The given code implements the right side view of a binary tree. It follows a level-order traversal approach using a queue. The steps are as follows:

1. The function `rightSideView` takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns a vector of integers representing the right side view.
2. It first checks if the root is `NULL`. If so, it means that the tree is empty, and there are no nodes. Therefore, it returns an empty vector.
3. If the root is not `NULL`, it initializes an empty vector called `answer` to store the right side view.
4. It uses a queue, `q`, to perform a level-order traversal of the binary tree. It starts by pushing the root node into the queue.
5. While the queue is not empty, it performs the following steps:
   - Get the current size of the queue, `n`, which represents the number of nodes in the current level.
   - Iterate `i` from 0 to `n-1` to process each node in the current level.
   - Pop the front node from the queue and store it in a temporary variable, `node`.
   - If `i` is equal to `n-1`, it means that the current node is the rightmost node in the current level. So, its value is pushed into the `answer` vector.
   - If the left child of the current node is not `NULL`, it is pushed into the queue.
   - If the right child of the current node is not `NULL`, it is pushed into the queue.
6. Finally, it returns the `answer` vector containing the values of the nodes in the right side view of the binary tree.

## Complexity Analysis

Let's assume n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

- Time Complexity: The code visits each node once and performs a constant amount of operations. Hence, the time complexity is O(n).
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is determined by the maximum number of nodes in a level. In the worst case, the maximum number of nodes in a level is n/2, where n is the total number of nodes in the binary tree. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> rightSideView(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == NULL)
            return {};

        vector<int> answer;
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int n = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();

                if (i == n - 1)
                    answer.push_back(node->val);
                if (node->left != NULL)
                    q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right != NULL)
                    q.push(node->right);
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
};
```

This code takes the root of a binary tree as input and returns a vector of integers representing the right side view of the tree. It performs a level-order traversal using a queue to store the nodes and processes them one level at a time. The values of the rightmost nodes in each level are added to the answer vector, which is then returned.
