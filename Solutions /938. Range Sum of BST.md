# Range Sum of BST

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and two integers `low` and `high`, return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range `[low, high]`.

## Approach

The given code implements the range sum operation in a binary search tree (BST) for nodes within a specified range `[low, high]`. It follows the following steps:

1. It defines a vector `v` to store the values of nodes in the inorder traversal order of the BST.
2. It defines a helper function `inorder` to perform the inorder traversal of the BST recursively. The `inorder` function takes a root node as an input.
   - Inside the `inorder` function, it checks if the root node is `NULL`. If so, it returns.
   - It recursively calls the `inorder` function on the left subtree of the current root node.
   - It pushes the value of the current root node (`root->val`) into the vector `v`.
   - It recursively calls the `inorder` function on the right subtree of the current root node.
3. It calls the `inorder` function with the root of the BST to populate the vector `v` with node values in the inorder traversal order.
4. It initializes a variable `ans` to store the sum of values within the specified range and sets it to 0.
5. It iterates over the elements in the vector `v`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current value (`v[i]`) is within the range `[low, high]`. If so, it adds the current value to the `ans` variable.
6. It returns the value of `ans`, which represents the sum of values within the specified range.

## Complexity Analysis

Let's assume n is the number of nodes in the binary search tree.

- Time Complexity: The code performs an inorder traversal of the BST, which takes O(n) time to visit all nodes. Additionally, it iterates over the elements in the vector `v` to calculate the sum, which takes O(n) time in the worst case. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).
- Space Complexity: The code uses additional space to store the values of nodes in the vector `v`. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary search tree.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> v;

    void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root)
            return;
        inorder(root->left);
        v.push_back(root->val);
        inorder(root->right);
    }

    int rangeSumBST(TreeNode* root, int low, int high) {
        inorder(root);
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
            if (v[i] >= low && v[i] <= high) {
                ans += v[i];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

This code takes the root of a binary search tree, a lower bound `low`, and an upper bound `high` as input. It calculates the sum of values of nodes in the BST that fall within the inclusive range `[low, high]` using an inorder traversal approach. It returns the computed sum.
