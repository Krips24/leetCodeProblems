# Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth. The maximum depth is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node to the farthest leaf node.

## Approach

The given code implements the calculation of the maximum depth of a binary tree. It follows a recursive approach using the concept of depth-first search (DFS). The steps are as follows:

1. The function `maxDepth` takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns an integer representing the maximum depth.
2. It checks if the root is `NULL`. If so, it means that the tree is empty, and its depth is considered as 0. Therefore, it returns 0.
3. If the root is not `NULL`, it recursively calculates the maximum depth of the left subtree by calling `maxDepth(root->left)` and stores the result in the variable `l`.
4. Similarly, it recursively calculates the maximum depth of the right subtree by calling `maxDepth(root->right)` and stores the result in the variable `r`.
5. It then returns the maximum of `l` and `r`, incremented by 1, since the depth at the current level is equal to the maximum depth among the left and right subtrees plus 1.

## Complexity Analysis

Let's assume n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

- Time Complexity: The code visits each node once and performs a constant amount of operations. Hence, the time complexity is O(n).
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is determined by the maximum depth of the recursive call stack. In the worst case, the tree can be skewed, resulting in a recursive call stack of depth n. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).
```

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == NULL)
            return 0;

        int l = maxDepth(root->left);
        int r = maxDepth(root->right);
        return max(l, r) + 1;
    }
};
```
