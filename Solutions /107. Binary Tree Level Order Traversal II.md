# Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II

## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

## Approach

The given code implements the bottom-up level order traversal of a binary tree. It follows a breadth-first search (BFS) approach using a queue. The steps are as follows:

1. The function `levelOrderBottom` takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns a vector of vectors of integers representing the bottom-up level order traversal.
2. It first checks if the root is `NULL`. If so, it means that the tree is empty, and there are no nodes. Therefore, it returns an empty vector.
3. If the root is not `NULL`, it initializes an empty vector of vectors called `main` to store the bottom-up level order traversal and a queue called `q` to perform the BFS traversal.
4. It starts by pushing the root node into the queue.
5. While the queue is not empty, it performs the following steps:
   - Get the current size of the queue, which represents the number of nodes in the current level.
   - Create a new vector called `primary` to store the nodes' values at the current level.
   - Iterate `i` from 0 to `size-1` to process each node in the current level.
   - Pop the front node from the queue and store it in a temporary variable, `node`.
   - If the left child of the current node is not `NULL`, it is pushed into the queue.
   - If the right child of the current node is not `NULL`, it is pushed into the queue.
   - Push the value of the current node into the `primary` vector.
   - After processing all the nodes in the current level, push the `primary` vector into the `main` vector.
6. Finally, the `main` vector is reversed using the `reverse` function to obtain the bottom-up level order traversal of the binary tree.

## Complexity Analysis

Let's assume n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

- Time Complexity: The code visits each node once and performs a constant amount of operations for each node. Hence, the time complexity is O(n).
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is determined by the maximum number of nodes in a level, which can be at most n/2. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).

## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> levelOrderBottom(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == NULL)
            return {};

        vector<vector<int>> main;
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            vector<int> primary;

            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                if (node->left != NULL)
                    q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right != NULL)
                    q.push(node->right);
                primary.push_back(node->val);
            }

            main.push_back(primary);
        }

        reverse(main.begin(), main.end());
        return main;
    }
};
